`hlb` is a high-level build language for [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/).

Describe your build in containerized units of work, and BuildKit will build your target as efficiently as possible.

## Key features

- Efficient, expressive, and repeatable builds
- Share build caches
- Extendable frontends to run Dockerfiles, or your publish your own

## Getting started

On the left side is a table of contents, organized into sections that can be expanded to show topics they cover. Both the sections and topics are ordered from basic to advanced concepts.

The guides are intended to contain practical explanations of how to write `hlb` builds, focusing on the most widely used features of `hlb`. For comprehensive documentation of every available instruction and option, see the [Reference](reference.md) and [Specification](specification.md).
 
The guides begin with a [quick start](intro/quickstart.md) to ensure your environment is working correctly, followed by a [tutorial](tutorial/lets-begin.md) on how to write your first `hlb` program.
