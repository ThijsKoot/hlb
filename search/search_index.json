You'll need to specify where the results go, e.g. to your host as a tarball, or pushed to a Docker registry. Now that we've verified hlb is functioning, it's time to start the tutorial .","title":"Run your first build"},{"location":"tutorial/arguments/","text":"At the end of the previous chapter, we were left with this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 fs src() { git \"https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git\" \"master\" } fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" with option { mount src \"/src\" mount fs { scratch; } \"/src/node_modules\" as nodeModules } } Currently our git repository is hardcoded into our program. Let's refactor it out so we can build nodeModules for other node projects. Refactoring our program \u00b6 When considering what to change to variables, we want to aim for extensibility. One approach may be to change the git remote into a variable, but that would mean we're stuck with git sources. Instead, let's refactor src to npmInstall 's function arguments so that we are opaque to where the source comes from. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 fs npmInstall(fs src) { image \"node:alpine\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" with option { mount src \"/src\" mount fs { scratch; } \"/src/node_modules\" as nodeModules } } Great! Now we can write a new function named remoteModules to pass in our git source. However, we don't want to invoke npmInstall because that will return the alpine filesystem, what we rather want is nodeModules . When an alias is declared in the body of a fs block, it also inherits the signature of the parent function. This is because nodeModules depends on the value of src , so when we defined a signature for npmInstall , nodeModules also inherited the signature: 1 fs nodeModules(fs src) We know how to invoke nodeModules , so let's pass the same git source we used earlier. 1 2 3 fs remoteModules() { nodeModules fs { git \"https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git\" \"master\"; } } There we have it. A reusable nodeModules function that is opaque to where the source code comes from. Let's take a look at one more type of source filesystem. Local sources \u00b6 So far we have been dealing with only remote sources like image and git , but what if you wanted to provide your working directory as a source filesystem? Turns out there is a source local that provides just that ability. Here's the signature: 1 2 # Rsyncs a local directory at path to a scratch filesystem. fs local(string path) We don't have a local node project at the moment, so let's write a function to initialize a node project and add left-pad as a dependency. We learnt how to use arguments just now, so let's apply our learnings and write a generic function. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 fs npmInit(string package) { image \"node:alpine\" dir \"/src\" run string { format \"npm init -y && npm install --package-lock-only %s\" package } with option { mount fs { scratch; } \"/src\" as nodeProject } } fs nodeProjectWithLeftPad() { nodeProject \"left-pad\" } This time, instead of passing a string literal, we can pass a string block literal where we have access to string functions like format . This allows us to interpolate values into string to install an arbitrary package. When you're ready, run a build targetting nodeProjectWithLeftPad and download the initialized node project. hlb run --target nodeProjectWithLeftPad --download . node.hlb You should see two new files package.json and package-lock.json in your working directory. $ ls node.hlb package.json package-lock.json Now we can use the local source to download node_modules , but let's also use a includePatterns option to specify exactly what files we should sync up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 fs localModules() { nodeModules fs { local \".\" with option { includePatterns \"package.json\" \"package-lock.json\" } } } And finally, we can run npm install remotely using our working directory and transfer back the node_modules . hlb run --target localModules --download node_modules node.hlb Advanced concepts \u00b6 You've made it to the end of basic concepts! Throughout the last few chapters, you wrote a few hlb programs to run npm install downloaded just the node_modules directory back to your system. You refactored it so that the function can be opaque to what the source comes from, and then you provided your working directory as a source filesystem.

It currently looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" run \"apk add -U git\" run \"git clone https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git /src\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" } fs nodeModules() { scratch copy npmInstall \"/src/node_modules\" \"/\" } If we change to a bigger project, copying over the node_modules to a scratch filesystem only to isolate the directory is pretty expensive. In this chapter, we'll learn about techniques to improve our build which isn't available through the Dockerfile frontend. Removing the unnecessary copy \u00b6 Instructions like image , run , and copy are also regular functions, and you must invoke them with the required arguments. But some builtin functions have optional features that can be accessed in an option block. For example, run has an optional function mount that temporarily mounts a filesystem to a mountpoint directory while run is executing. The builtin mount function has the following signature: 1 2 # Mounts a source filesystem to the specific mountpoint. fs mount(fs source, string mountpoint) We can apply options to the run function by adding with <option> after the arguments, where option can be a function or a block literal. Let's first take a look at block literals. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # A block literal that returns type `option`. option { mount foo \"/foo\" mount bar \"/bar\" } # An inline block literal that returns type `fs`. fs { scratch; } option { # Mount taking a `fs` block literal as the source filesystem. mount fs { scratch; } \"/output\" } Block literals cannot be defined in the global scope, but you can define them where an argument is expected. When the statements within a block are all in one line, each statement must be suffixed with a ; as a delimiter. In the final example above, we defined an option block literal that mounts a scratch filesystem into /output , ready to receive output files. Handy! Now with this new ability, let's avoid the unnecessary copy ! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" run \"apk add -U git\" run \"git clone https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git /src\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" with option { mount fs { scratch; } \"/src/node_modules\" } } This time, when npm install runs, it will write the files directly into the scratch filesystem we mounted to /src/node_modules . Hooray! But wait, if we run the build targeting npmInstall , that will still give us the alpine filesystem. Not only that, once npm install has finished, the scratch filesystem will be unmounted leaving behind no node_modules directory at all! Haven't we made things worse? Fear not, for there is still one last concept to introduce! Defining aliases \u00b6 Currently, the only targets we can run are functions we defined in the global scope. We can also target statements inside the body of a function by defining an alias. After the arguments to the function and the optional with <option> block, you can add as <identifier> to define an alias for the filesystem at that step. Usually options are not allowed to be aliased but mount is an exception. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" run \"apk add -U git\" run \"git clone https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git /src\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" with option { mount fs { scratch; } \"/src/node_modules\" as nodeModules } } Try running a build targetting nodeModules now, and this time we don't have to download it. hlb run --target nodeModules node.hlb Your build should complete slightly quicker (or much quicker if you had more dependencies), but we don't have to stop there. We briefly mentioned in the previous chapter that we chose to start from a filesystem of a Docker image, so we can explore other source functions too. Git sources \u00b6 Before npm install happens, we need to clone the repository, and before that happens we need to download the node:alpine image. However, cloning the repository doesn't strictly depend on the node:alpine image. What if we could pull the image and clone the repository concurrently? Using the mount function we just learnt, we can define a new fs function that clones the repository and mount it. But that will still require another image. Luckily for us there is a git builtin function that can efficiently prepare a filesystem containing a git repository! Here's the signature: 1 2 3 # Creates a scratch filesystem with a git repostory from remote checked out at # a specified branch, commit or tag. fs git(string remote, string ref) Instead of cloning the repository and then running it, we can implicitly depend on a function that checkouts our repository. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 fs src() { git \"https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git\" \"master\" } fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" with option { mount src \"/src\" mount fs { scratch; } \"/src/node_modules\" as nodeModules } } Run the build again to see the speed improve once again. hlb run --target npmInstall node.hlb Formatting Consistency helps with readability, so hlb comes with a formatter so that programs will look consistently formatted. Simply run hlb format -w node.hlb and it will format your file for you. Recap \u00b6 At the end of two chapters, we have wrote our first hlb program and optimized it by writing node_modules into a mount. Then we improved it a little more by leveraging a git source, allowing the clone to happen concurrently with the pull of the node:alpine image. You may have noticed that all this time, all our functions we defined had no arguments.

In this tutorial, we will write a hlb program to fetch the node_modules of a node project. Along the way, you will learn the basics of creating and debugging a build graph. If you ever get stuck at any point of the tutorial, feel free to clone hlb-tutorial to get a complete working example. Defining a function \u00b6 Let's start by creating a new directory and a file node.hlb . This is where we will write our hlb program. We will begin by defining a function which will become our target to build later. 1 2 3 fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" } A function begins with a return type , an identifier , an optional list of arguments , and then followed by a body enclosed in braces. The body must be non-empty, and in this example we are starting from a filesystem of a Docker image node:alpine . Since we haven't executed anything, we aren't done yet. Let's add a few more instructions to complete our program: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 fs npmInstall() { image \"node:alpine\" run \"apk add -U git\" run \"git clone https://github.com/left-pad/left-pad.git /src\" dir \"/src\" run \"npm install\" } If you are thinking, \"Hey, that looks like Dockerfile!\", then you would be right! hlb is a superset of the features from Dockerfiles, but designed to leverage the full power of BuildKit. Let's go over what we did. Fetched git using alpine's package manager apk Cloned a simple node project from stash Changed the current working directory to /src Run npm install , which should produce a directory at /src/node_modules containing all the dependencies for the node project When you are ready, save the node.hlb file and run the build by using the hlb binary we previously installed. hlb run --target npmInstall node.hlb You generated a node_modules directory, but since nothing was exported it is still with the BuildKit daemon. Of course, that is what we will be learning next. Exporting a directory \u00b6 Now that our build graph produces a /src/node_modules , one thing we might want to do is to export it to our system. However, if we export the target npmInstall , we'll not only get the node_modules directory, but also the rest of the alpine filesystem. In order to isolate the directory we want, we need to copy it to a new filesystem. 1 2 3 4 fs nodeModules() { scratch copy npmInstall \"/src/node_modules\" \"/\" } As we learned earlier, we can define functions which we can later target when running the build. In this new function, we are starting from a scratch filesystem (an empty one), and then copying the /src/node_modules from npmInstall . Since hlb is a functional language, variables and functions cannot be modified dynamically. When we copy from npmInstall , it is always referring to a snapshot of its filesystem after all its instructions have been executed. If we want to modify npmInstall , we will have to write a new function that starts from npmInstall but it will have to be defined with a new identifier. Now that we have isolated the directory, we can download the filesystem (containing only the node_modules ) by specifying --download <dest-dir> : hlb run --target nodeModules --download . node.hlb After the build have finished, you should see the node_modules in your working directory. $ ls node_modules node.hlb $ tree node_modules | tail -n 1 307 directories, 4014 files $ rm -rf node_modules Once you have verified the directory is correct, remove it so we can keep our workspace clean.
